# leetCode-SQL
============

Hi, this repo contains my answers for all the SQL questions on LeetCode. All the answers have passed all the test cases and are store as String format in the [SQL.py](/SQL.py). For most of my answers, they are faster than at least 75% of MySQL online submissions for Queries Quality and Percentage. And some of them are faster than 99% of all submissions. I also provided multi answers for some questions and explained why some of them are faster.

Hope these answers can help you!
